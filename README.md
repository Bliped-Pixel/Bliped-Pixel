- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bliped-Pixel
- 👀 I’m interested in programming obviously, but I do love to consume a lot of content in a wide range of media.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++ and python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on in projects which can give insight of how projects genrally are taken care of, I'm not picky with projects, as long as I learn out of it, that's fine
- 📫 you can reach me using muntasirthameem@gmail.com
